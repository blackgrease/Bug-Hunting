# Bug-Hunting

A little different approach to introducing Bug Hunting. The approach may be unconvential principles/perspectives but everyones learning journey is different and in someways, our individual jourenys may benefit others in ways we do not know.
The more I grow, so does this repository. Nothing here will be theoretical and neither will I expose any companies/organizations. This is purely technical and approaches how to find bugs based on actual outcomes.
